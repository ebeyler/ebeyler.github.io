I am a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/). I am part of the [SIERRA team](https://sierra-mlopt.github.io/), a joint project between [ENS](https://www.di.ens.fr/), [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-paris) and [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/fr/page-daccueil).

Before that, I was a student in the [Mathematics Department of the École Normale Supérieure](https://www.math.ens.psl.eu/en/welcome/) and I completed an MSc in Machine Learning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com)) at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).
